### What are templates?

Binary templates, one of the most powerful features of **010 Editor**, allow you to break down almost any binary file into a series of variables. Templates make it much easier to understand and edit binary files than regular HEX editors.  
Each template is stored as a text file with the **.bt** extension and can be edited directly in **010 Editor**.

### How to use templates?

1. Install [010 Editor](https://www.sweetscape.com/010editor "010 Editor homepage") and launch it.
2. Drag the file you want to analyze into the editor.
3. From the menu, select *Templates > Open template* or use *CTRL+F5*.
4. Choose a template from the */Project-IGI/templates/...* folder that matches the format of the file you selected earlier.
5. Go to the tab of the selected file and click the *Run template* button.
